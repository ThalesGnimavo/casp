# Changelog

## 0.5.0 — 2026-06-16

- **New — configurable `sessions_dir` / `logs_dir`.** Two OPTIONAL `state.json` keys let a project point the validator at its real layout instead of adopting CASP's. Prompts still default to `docs/plan/sessions` and logs to `session-logs`; set either key and the *entire* protocol honors it — `casp check` (every claim, the shipped-history dirs, the state-bump surface, the uncommitted-changes pathspec), `casp new prompt|log`, `casp ship` (the wired `session_log` pointer), and `casp close` (newest-log detection). All messages print the **resolved** path, never the hardcoded default. Backward-compatible: a repo that sets neither key behaves exactly as before (every prior test stays green). Minor bump for new schema keys. Motivated by onboarding **a downstream project**, whose existing layout the hardcoded paths forced it to abandon.
- **Single resolver, one source of truth.** The three state-surface directories (sessions, logs, migrations) now resolve in one place (`resolveDirs` in `shared.ts`) — composed per-root so `check --all` honors each cockpit's own layout. `migrations_dir` keeps its existing no-default, opt-in semantics (a project with no migration concept reports none).
- **Out of scope, documented.** A single rolling next-prompt FILE (one `NEXT-SESSION-PROMPT.md` rather than a directory of per-session prompts) is **not** modeled — `next_prompt` already points at any file today, and `sessions_dir` governs the directory `check` scans and `new`/`ship` write into, not a single-file lifecycle. Modeling a rolling file is a different concept and was deliberately not built.
- Four new regression tests (34 total): custom-layout clean repo passes; a claim against a missing CUSTOM dir FAILs with the resolved name; shipped-history FAILs name the configured dirs; `new`/`ship`/`close` all write into the configured layout.

## 0.4.2 — 2026-06-16

- **Fix — `casp check --all <absolute path>` no longer doubles the path.** The optional root argument was `join`ed onto the current directory unconditionally, so an absolute root (`casp check --all /Users/me/projects`) became `<cwd>/Users/me/projects` and reported "no casp/ cockpit found." It now `resolve()`s the argument — an absolute root is used as-is; a relative root still resolves against the cwd; the no-arg (cwd) form is unchanged. Found within minutes of dogfooding `check --all` across the workspace for the fleet-gate launch. One new regression test (30 total).

## 0.4.1 — 2026-06-15

- **Fix — a fresh `casp init` is now green under `casp check` out of the box.** `init` scaffolded a `state.json` whose `next_prompt` pointed at `docs/plan/sessions/PHASE-1-FIRST-SLICE.md`, but never created that file — so the very first `casp check` a new user runs (step 5 of `init`'s own printed instructions) FAILed with "next_prompt points at a missing file." `init` now also scaffolds the `docs/plan/sessions/` and `session-logs/` directories and writes that first session prompt (from the canonical template, status `queued`). A brand-new repo now goes `init → status → check` with **0 FAIL**. Idempotent — an existing prompt is never overwritten. Found by onboarding a real project (a downstream project).

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-15

- **New — `casp ship <slug>`.** The mechanical half of closing a session, automated: flips the phase's prompt to `status: shipped`, wires its `session_log` pointer, and moves the slug from `phases_queued` to `phases_shipped`. Resolves the slug against `docs/plan/sessions/*.md` by normalized name (so `0.4-close-loop` matches `PHASE-04-CLOSE-LOOP.md`), or takes `--prompt <path>`. Idempotent on re-run; refuses an unknown slug or a `pending` session-log id. **Touches no git** — the operator owns the commit.
- **New — `casp close`.** The guided deterministic close: auto-detects `last_commit` (HEAD) and `last_session_id` (newest session log), lets you confirm or override them (`--yes` / `--commit` / `--log` for non-interactive use), bumps `updated_at`, then runs `check` and exits with its verdict. `last_commit` is set to the current HEAD so the operator's own state-bump commit lands as the canonical close-loop PASS. **Never runs git** — no add, commit, or push. A state verb, not a harness.
- **New — `casp check --all [root]`.** Validates every `casp/` cockpit under a root in one report (per-cockpit verdict + aggregate), exits 1 if any cockpit drifts. `--all --json` emits a per-cockpit array under the existing schema. The fleet gate for "many agents, many repos." Internally, per-root validation was extracted into a pure `checkOne(root)` — single-root output and exit code are unchanged.
- **Change — migrations are now fully opt-in.** A project with no `migrations_dir` and no `migrations_applied` gets **no migration finding at all** (not even a PASS), so non-code cockpits (content, launch ops, research) carry zero migration noise. `casp init` no longer scaffolds `migrations_dir: "drizzle"`. A non-empty `migrations_applied` with no `migrations_dir` set is drift (FAIL): a claim with nothing to verify against. Existing repos that declare `migrations_dir` are unaffected.
- Ten new regression tests (27 total) covering ship, close (including the never-commits invariant), optional-migration silence, and `--all` aggregation.

## 0.3.2 — 2026-06-11

- **Docs only.** No code or CLI behavior change. Existing installs at 0.3.1 keep working unchanged.
- **The public roadmap is now the validated one.** Order by leverage: `install-hook` first (the gate stops being optional), then the pre-session gate on `casp next`, configurable paths, `status --json`, `verify <commit>` + `state diff`, and a demand-gated tail (binaries, narrow rollback, CI installer, webhook notifier). **`casp lint` is cut** — an LLM verb inside the CASP binary, even advisory, would undercut the deterministic claim; prose-vs-reality checking belongs in the agent reading `casp/`.

## 0.3.1 — 2026-06-10

- **Fix — Alembic (Python) migrations are now recognized.** The `migrations.match` check only counted `.sql` files, so a Python shop (`backend/alembic/versions/`) got a guaranteed false FAIL: every applied revision reported as missing from disk. The filter now accepts `.sql` and `.py`, ignoring dunder entries (`__init__.py`, `__pycache__`). Found within minutes of running 0.3.0 against a production FastAPI/Alembic repo (a production repo).
- **Fix — multi-log `session_log` values are supported (YAML list or comma-separated).** A phase shipped across several sessions legitimately lists all its logs in one frontmatter value (`session_log: [session-logs/a.md, session-logs/b.md]`). The validator treated the whole value as a single path and FAILed. Each entry is now resolved independently (repo-relative), and a FAIL names only the entries that are actually missing.
- Two new regression tests (17 total).

## 0.3.0 — 2026-06-10

- **Fix (verdict-changing) — no more false green when a claimed directory is missing.** A check that cannot find what it needs no longer silently skips: when `state.json` makes a claim that requires a directory and that directory is absent, `casp check` now **FAILs** with a `cannot verify <claim>` finding. Three claims are enforced: a real `last_session_id` requires `session-logs/` (`last_session.logs_dir`), a non-empty `migrations_applied` requires the migrations directory (`migrations.dir` — the canonical drift example itself was a false green when the dir was missing), and a non-empty `phases_shipped` requires both `docs/plan/sessions/` and `session-logs/` (`shipped_history.*`). Fresh-init placeholders and empty arrays are not claims and do not FAIL. **Repos that previously reported green may now correctly report drift — re-run `casp check` everywhere after upgrading.** Minor version bump for exactly that reason.
- **Fix — the canonical close loop no longer ends in a permanent WARN.** `last_commit` now reports **PASS** when it is the parent of HEAD and the HEAD commit touches only the state surface (`casp/`, `docs/plan/sessions/`, `session-logs/`) — the state-bump commit the protocol itself prescribes. Any other commit past `last_commit` stays WARN. `casp check` on CASP's own repo is now fully green (13 PASS · 0 WARN · 0 FAIL), previously a permanent explainable WARN.
- **Change — `last_session_id: "pending"` is now a WARN, not a FAIL.** Consistent with `last_commit: "pending"`: a fresh-init placeholder is not a verifiable claim. A fresh parked cockpit checks clean.
- **Hardening (from the two-auditor review).** An empty-string `last_session_id` now FAILs (`last_session.id_empty`) instead of silently skipping the check; every claim-backed path must be a real **directory** — a file squatting `session-logs/`, `docs/plan/sessions/` or the migrations dir reports a clean FAIL instead of crashing `readdirSync` (which also broke the `--json` always-valid guarantee).
- Nine new regression tests (15 total) covering the false-green class, placeholder semantics, state-bump recognition, and the file-squatting crash paths.


## 0.2.4 — 2026-06-10

- **New — `casp check --json`.** Machine-readable validator report: every check category as structured PASS/WARN/FAIL findings (stable `id`, `label`, `detail`, `fix`), plus `verdict`, `exit_code` and a `summary` block. The schema is documented in `docs/check-json.md` and versioned (`schema_version: 1`, bumps only on breaking changes). Strictly additive: the default human-readable output is unchanged, and the exit-code contract is identical — `--json` changes the *format* of the report, never the verdict. Even a missing or unparsable `casp/state.json` emits well-formed JSON (single `state.file` FAIL finding), so consumers never need a non-JSON fallback. Covered by four new tests in `npm test`.
- **Internal — version helper moved to `shared.ts`** (`pkgVersion()`), so both the CLI banner and the JSON report read the version from `package.json` at runtime. No behavior change.
- **Fix — `casp init` no longer scaffolds `.DS_Store`.** A Finder junk file sitting in a local clone's `templates/` was copied into the user's `casp/` directory (found by dogfooding `casp init` on the CASP repo itself; published npm installs were unaffected since `npm pack` strips `.DS_Store`).
- **CASP now manages itself.** The repo carries its own `casp/` cockpit (`state.json`, `now.md`, `roadmap.md`), session prompts and session logs — `casp check` runs green on the CASP repo before every push. Recursive validation: the tool that gates state drift is itself gated.

## 0.2.3 — 2026-06-10

- **Docs only.** No code or CLI behavior change. Existing installs at 0.2.2 keep working unchanged.
- **Repositioned the README and `package.json` description for the autonomous-model era.** The headline now leads with the deterministic, model-agnostic wedge — *the model holds the context; CASP proves the state is true, against git* — and frames CASP as the **complement** to long-running autonomous coding models (Claude Code today, any model next), not a competitor to their in-session memory. The prior "runs the whole roadmap / never loses the thread" line collided with how the new model generation now markets itself.

## 0.2.2 — 2026-06-09

- **Fix — `casp check` no longer FAILs a legitimately parked project.** `next_phase` and `next_prompt` may now be `null` (a project with no queued next slice — launch hold, roadmap complete, frozen). The keys must still be present, but an explicit `null` reports as PASS ("parked — no queued next slice") instead of a drift FAIL. Previously a parked `state.json` (e.g. a project in launch-mode hold) produced two false FAILs and blocked the push.
- **Fix — `casp --version` derives from `package.json` at runtime.** The version is no longer a hardcoded constant in `src/cli.ts` (which had silently desynced: the CLI reported `0.2.0` while npm shipped `0.2.1`). This is the same class of bug fixed by hand in 0.1.2 and regressed in 0.2.0; reading `package.json` removes the manual step for good.
- Exit-code contract still covered by `npm test` (clean → 0, drift → 1); both fixes verified green.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-06-09

- **Docs only.** No code or CLI behavior change. Existing installs at 0.2.0 keep working unchanged.
- **Repositioned the README and `package.json` description.** The headline now leads with the outcome — *your AI agent runs the whole project roadmap across sessions, writes its own next-session prompt, logs every session, and can't lose the thread* — with drift-detection kept as the trust guarantee rather than the pitch. The old "refuses to let your state lie" tagline was a previous agent's framing that buried the actual value.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-06-08

- **BREAKING — renamed Cockpit → CASP (Coding-Agent State Protocol).** The name "Cockpit" collided head-on with Red Hat Cockpit (cockpit-project.org); CASP relaunches the tool as a *protocol*, positioned the way MCP positioned itself.
- **npm package renamed `@justethales/cockpit` → `@justethales/casp`.** Install is now `npm i -g @justethales/casp` (the bare name `casp` is blocked by npm's name-similarity policy, so the package stays scoped; the CLI command is still `casp`). The old package is frozen; existing installs must reinstall under the new name.
- **CLI binary renamed `cockpit` → `casp`.** All verbs keep their names: `casp init | status | check | next | new prompt | new log`.
- **Slash-command `/cockpit` → `/casp`** (read-only status). `/next` is unchanged. The skills bundle directory moved `skills/cockpit/` → `skills/casp/`.
- **Scaffolded directory renamed `cockpit/` → `casp/`.** `casp init` now writes `casp/state.json`, `casp/now.md`, `casp/roadmap.md`, `casp/README.md`. Projects on the old layout should `git mv cockpit casp` once.
- **New verb `casp next`** — prints the next session's prompt straight from `state.next_prompt` (the CLI analogue of `/next`), pipe-friendly and non-zero when there is no actionable prompt.
- **`casp check` exit-code contract is now tested** (`npm test`): clean state → exit 0, drifted state → exit 1. The CI status check is real, not decorative.
- Repository moved to `github.com/ThalesGnimavo/casp`; homepage is `https://casp.sh`. Positioning, README and `package.json` description now lead with drift-detection / state-validation ("validates state against git — doesn't just store it"), not "memory".

## 0.1.2 — 2026-06-04

- **Docs only.** No code or CLI behavior change. Existing installs at 0.1.1 keep working unchanged.
- Repository migrated from `github.com/justethales/cockpit-skill` to `github.com/ThalesGnimavo/cockpit-skill` (GitHub username rename). All README badges, links, `package.json` repository/homepage/bugs, and source-file references updated.
- npm package name unchanged: still `@justethales/cockpit`. `npm i @justethales/cockpit` continues to work for all users.
- Fixed stale `VERSION = '0.1.0'` constant in `src/cli.ts` so `cockpit --version` now reports the correct release.
- Fixed dead `@thales/cockpit` reference still present in `templates/README.md` (the 0.1.1 cleanup missed this one).
- X/Twitter handle in README updated to `@ThalesGnimavo`.

## 0.1.1 — 2026-05-31

- **Docs only.** No code changes.
- README rewritten for clarity + npm/Google discoverability: stronger H1, badges, npm-friendly elevator pitch, agent compatibility matrix (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Continue), CLI reference table, citation block, public roadmap.
- `package.json` description rewritten and `keywords` expanded.
- Dropped the inflated "200-line discipline" claim from description and README — the validator alone is ~500 lines.
- Fixed the dead `@thales/cockpit` install commands left in the README. Everything now points at `@justethales/cockpit`.
- Bumped CHANGELOG to reflect that `check` ships 9 categories (the 0.1.0 entry said 7).

## 0.1.0 — 2026-05-30

Initial release.

- `cockpit init` — scaffolds a `cockpit/` directory with `state.json`, `now.md`, `roadmap.md`, `README.md`, and the three canonical templates (`session-prompt.md`, `session-log.md`, `audit-brief.md`).
- `cockpit check` — validator with 7 categories. Exits 1 on FAIL. ANSI output. `--quiet` flag for CI.
- `cockpit status` — one-screen snapshot. `--plain` flag strips ANSI.
- `cockpit new prompt --slug X` — copies the session-prompt template to `docs/plan/sessions/`.
- `cockpit new log --slug X` — copies the session-log template to `session-logs/`.
- Claude Code skills bundle (`skills/cockpit/`, `skills/next/`) — drop into `~/.claude/skills/` for instant `/cockpit` and `/next` slash commands.
